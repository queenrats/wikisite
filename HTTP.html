        <h1>Addressing and HTTP</h1>
        <br>
        <h3>Addressing</h3>
        <p>Devices connected to a network are assigned IP addresses so that they can communicate with each other. On your home network assigning IP addresses is handled by the router.</p>
        <p>IP addresses can be either IPv4 or IPv6, and they look a bit different from each other. For example, 142.250.187.227 is an IPv4 address, and 2a00:1450:4009:822::2004 is an IPv6 address.</p>
        <p>Most browsers support navigating to IPv4 addresses by typing them into the search bar or website bar. Try it with the IPv4 address above! Where does it lead?</p>

        <br>

        <h3>HTTP</h3>
        <p>If you've spent time on the World Wide Web, you've probably noticed "http://" or "https://" before the website address in your browser bar.</p>
        <p>HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is a standardised way for web-servers and clients to communicate with each other. There are two main request types, but there are other less commonly used ones as well.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The two main request types are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>GET - this is used to request data</li>
            <li>POST - this is used to send data</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <p>If a site has the jQuery library loaded you can use the console in your browser (usually found in the menu brought up with F12) to send a POST request to the site using the command "$.post()". Remember to remove the quote marks when you try it!</p>
